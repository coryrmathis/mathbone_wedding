            &emsp;We're so excited for you to celebrate with us on our wedding day! You can find details on the info and accomdations pages but in short, we're camping!  We understand tenting it isn't for everybody so luckily Ozark Outdoors (our venue) offers a variety of lodging options if you want to spend the night with us!  If not, the venue is about an hour outside of St. Louis so feel free to carpool in and head back home the same day!

Lodging info, driving directions and any other info you might need are provided in the links above.
